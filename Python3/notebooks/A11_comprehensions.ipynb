    "As discussed elsewhere, everything is immutable in Functional programming.  As a consequence, functional programmers do not want to use \"for\" loops because the loop counter is mutable.  As an alternative, Python offers a \"list comprehension\" that only uses immutable elements.\n",

    "In the following example, the comprehension:\n",
    "<pre>[x**3 for x in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)]</pre>\n",
    "is read as <pre>for every value x in the tuple, compute x\\**3</pre>\n",
    "Thus you read comprehensions back to front; the for clause first and the cpmutation (x\\**3) last.  Many people find this confusing at first, but you soon get used to it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A subtle point (lost on some people) is that despite appearances, \"x\" is immutable.  That's because there are 5 different \"x\"s that are all immutable, rather than one \"x\" that is mutable.  \n",
