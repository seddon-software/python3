    "Dictionaries are implemented using a hashing algorithm.  Normally it's not too important to know how things are implemented, but in the case of dictionaries it will help us understand why keys have to be unique and immutable and why earlier versions of Python did not define an order for dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the case where the keys are immutable strings.  Python defines a set of slots or bins for the key/value pairs (or more correctly for the pointers to key/value pairs).  Typically there are more bins than key/value pairs.  Each bin is either empty or contains a pointer to the key/value pair, however sometimes a bin contains more than one pointer to key/value pairs.  The ideal situation is when there is zero or one pointer per bin, but if there are more than one pointer in a bin it is called a collision and this affects performance.  More of that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of the matter is how do we decide which bin to place a pointer to a key/value pair.  The answer is hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dictionary with, say 100 bins.  Given a key, \"John\" and a value 28000, which bin will we use?  Now strings have a built-in hash function which generates a number.  If we take the remainder on dividing by the number of bins (100) we will get a number in the range 0 to 99.  We can use this as the bin for this key/value pair."
